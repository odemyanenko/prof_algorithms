To write a program that reads a text file, counts the occurrences of each word, and prints the results in Java, you can follow these steps:

Read the Text File:
Open and read the text file line by line. You can use a BufferedReader to efficiently read the file.

Tokenize the Text:
Tokenize each line into words. You can use regular expressions or a simple split operation on spaces to extract words. Convert words to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive word counting.

Count Word Occurrences:
Use a data structure (e.g., a HashMap<String, Integer>) to keep track of word occurrences. Loop through the words and increment their count in the map.

Print the Results:
After reading the entire file, iterate through the map and print each word along with its count.
